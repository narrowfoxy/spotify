## Introduction
This project is a music player application developed using React JS. It allows users to play their favorite songs, search for music, control playback, and switch between different tabs for personalized music recommendations and top tracks.

## Features
âœ¨ Use React JS for a powerful and flexible UI development experience.
âœ¨ Responsive application that adapts to smaller screens, with the player component serving as the main interface and a menu button to access a list of songs.
âœ¨ Utilize GraphQL to efficiently load the list data.
âœ¨ Ensure uninterrupted music playback even if the user visits another tab, such as the Favorites tab.
âœ¨ Dynamically change the background gradient color based on the cover image of the currently playing song, as indicated in the design.
âœ¨ Create a fluid and interactive interface with captivating animations and transitions, such as a loading animation for the song list and background color change animation.
âœ¨ Provide essential functionality, including search capability, music control (play/pause/next/previous), tab navigation (e.g., switching from "For You" to "Top Tracks"), and controlling music playback via a seeker.
